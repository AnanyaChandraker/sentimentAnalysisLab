  # Dev Labs: Build a Sentiment Analysis App in minutes using Amplify Framework

In this workshop we will demonstrate how to add the AI and ML cloud service feature to your web application with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and the [Amplify Framework](https://aws-amplify.github.io/). We will learn to integrate following 3 AWS Services in your web application in few minutes

1. **Amazon Cognito**- Fully managed User Management
2. **Amazon Transcribe** - Adds speech-to-text capability
3. **Amazon Comprehend** -  Uses ML to find insights and relationships in text.


# Install the Amplify CLI 

Install the AWS Amplify CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

## Clone the UI from GitHub and Install dependencies

```bash
Run following scripts provided to automate the project and installing dependencies:
sh cleanup.sh
sh setup.sh
```

OR 

```bash
mkdir ~/Desktop/devlabs
cd ~/Desktop/devlabs
git clone https://github.com/rahulbaisla/sentimentAnalysisLab.git
cd sentimentAnalysisLab
npm install
```

## Initialize Amplify

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/devlabs/sentimentAnalysisLab
amplify init
```

`Enter a name for the project:` **sentimentAnalysisLab**

`Enter a name for the environment:` **dev**

`Choose your default editor:` **Visual Studio Code**

`Choose the type of app that you're building:` **javascript**
 
`What javascript framework are you using:` **react**

`Source Directory Path:`  **src**

`Distribution Directory Path:` **build**

`Build Command:`  **npm run-script build**

`Start Command:` **npm run-script start**

`Do you want to use an AWS profile?` **Yes**

`Please choose the profile you want to use` **default**


The AWS Amplify CLI will initialize a new project inside your React project & you will see a new folder: `amplify`. The files in this folder hold your project configuration.

## Add Authentication to the Web Application


`amplify add auth`
`Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration?` **Default configuration**

`Warning: you will not be able to edit these selections. 
How do you want users to be able to sign in?` **Username**

`Do you want to configure advanced settings?` **No, I am done.**

## Add Speech-To-Text Functionality

`amplify add Predictions`

`Please select from one of the categories below:` **Convert**

`What would you like to convert?` **Transcribe text from audio**

`Provide a friendly name for your resource:` **transcription**

`What is the source language?`  **US English**

`Who should have access?`  **Auth users only**



## Add Speech-To-Text Functionality

`amplify add Predictions`

`Please select from one of the categories below:` **Interpret**

`What would you like to interpret Interpret:` **Text**

`Provide a friendly name for your resource:` **interpret**

`What kind of interpretation would you like?` **All**

`Who should have access? ` **Auth users only**


## Push the Backend to AWS Cloud

amplify push
```
âœ” Successfully pulled backend environment dev from the cloud.

Current Environment: dev

| Category    | Resource name                | Operation | Provider plugin   |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Auth        | sentimentanalysislab | Create    | awscloudformation |
| Predictions | transcription                | Create    | awscloudformation |
| Predictions | interpret                    | Create    | awscloudformation |

Are you sure you want to continue? Yes
```


## Test the Application

1. 
```
In your project directory ~/Desktop/devlabs/sentimentAnalysisLab run following command
npm run start
```

2. Create an user account

3. Sign-in to the Application

    ![](images/SignIn.png "Sign In")

4. Start Recording and speak some text. Once finished stop the recording.

The audio will be converted into text using Amazon Transcribe Service and the converted text will be interpreted to perform sentiment analysis using Amazon Comprehend Service.


## Understanding the code

Imports 
```
import Amplify, { Predictions } from 'aws-amplify';
import { AmazonAIPredictionsProvider } from '@aws-amplify/predictions';
import { withAuthenticator, AmplifyTheme} from 'aws-amplify-react';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';
```

Convert recorder audio to text and performing sentiment analysis on text  
```
function convertFromBuffer(bytes) {
    setResponse('Performing Sentiment Analysis...');

    Predictions.convert({
        transcription: {
          source: {
            bytes
          },
           language: "en-US", // other options are "en-GB", "fr-FR", "fr-CA", "es-US"
        },
      }).then(({ transcription: { fullText } }) => {interpretFromPredictions(JSON.stringify(fullText, null, 2))})
        .catch(err => console.log(JSON.stringify(err, null, 2)))   
  }

  function interpretFromPredictions(textToInterpret) {
    console.log("inside interpretFromPredictions")
    Predictions.interpret({
      text: {
        source: {
          text: textToInterpret,
        },
        type: "ALL"
      }
    }).then(result => {setResponse(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));setGauge(result);})
      .catch(err => setResponse(JSON.stringify(err, null, 2)))
  }
```
